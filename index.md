## Brief Intro

Allow me to briefly introduce myself. My name is Kirill and I am a senior technical writer. I immensely enjoy exploring various subject matters, building a holistic picture in my mind, and then putting disorganized, unstructured, or missing pieces of information together to form concise, scannable, user-friendly, and intuitive documentation.

Ideally, the more densely information is packed in as little content as possible, the better the documentation. This can be achieved through the combination of excellent writing skills, intuitive formatting, and the use of visuals. In this regard, I highly respect the latest trends of addressing us as technical communicators or technical authors. This trend signals that we not only write text, but also increasingly use more modern forms of conveying knowledge, such as pictures, videos, interactive online widgets, and so on.

I have also been actively learning [DocOps](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/doc-ops/) -- tooling, maintenance, and deployment of documentation. No doubt, writing good documentation is important, however, making the best use of it is even more important. It means that documentation needs to be accessible at the right place and at the right time. All in all, this website is a manifestation of my efforts to learn DocOps.

On top of that, I am also making steady progress in knowledge management, project management, teaching technical writing, incessantly read new books and trying to keep up with the latest trends in my occupation. After re-reading what I wrote above, I found myself thinking that keeping up with so many things might feel like a burden. Luckily, it comes natural to me, since I enjoy my trade and stay in harmony with what I do.


## Writing Samples

As documentation development is a muti-faceted process, I list all my contributions under each writing sample respectively.

- [User Guide for a development board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-esp32-s2-kaluga-1-kit.html)
  - The template for this document type was developed and standardized by me; now widely used.
  - I wrote this multipage user guide (main board and extension boards) following my template.
  - To collect the initial data, I interviewed SMEs and tried the actual product.
  - Templates for diagrams and annotated images were improved and standardized by me based on the motley collection of styles that existed at that time.
  - The diagrams and annotated images were created by me following the respective templates, except for the source images of the product that a photographer took following my directions.
- [Content Functions](content-functions)
  - My attempt to adapt the Di√°taxis framework to my current company's documentation.
- [Create Professionally Looking Diagrams](create-prof-looking-diagrams)
  - Excerpt from the guidelines accompanying the diagram templates.
  - All conceived and written by me from scratch.
- [LibreOffice Draw Cheatsheet](./images/libreoffice-draw-cheatsheet.pdf) (PDF)
  - Created using LibreOffice Draw to allow for the more complex formatting in tables.
  - All the tips were developed and incorporated into the diagram templates by me.
