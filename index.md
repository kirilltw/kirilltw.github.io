## Brief Intro

Let me briefly introduce myself. I am Kirill -- a senior technical writer with a view to become a DocOps engineer. Since DocOps is not yet one of the buzz words in the IT industry, it can be easily explained as DevOps applied to documentation tooling, maintenance, deployment, etc. *DocOps* is a relatively new thing on the block that I first spotted in a Write The Docs [article](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/doc-ops/) and instantly liked.
